# Charge Distributions
## Density
- Charge density describes the amount a charge per unit length, area, or volume. Linear (length) charge density is represented by \\(\lambda\\), surface (area) charge density is represented by \\(\sigma\\), and volume charge density is denoted as \\(\rho\\)
- The different types of density follow the equations: 
\\[\lambda=\frac Ql \;\;\;\;\;\;\; 
\sigma=\frac Q A    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
\rho=\frac Q V \\]
	where \\(Q\\) is the charge in a region, \\(l\\) is the region's length, \\(A\\) is surface area, and \\(V\\) is volume
- To find the total charge in a region, you have to evaluate the integral
\\[Q=\int\rho dV\\]
where \\(\rho\\) and \\(V\\) can be replaced with the corresponding density and area/length variables needed.

## Symmetry
- A charge distribution is spherically symmetric if you can draw a spherical shell around the center and the surface density is the same at any point on its surface.
- A charge distribution is cylindrically symmetric if you can draw a cylindrical shell around central line of charge and the surface density is the same at any point on its surface.
- A charge distribution has planar symmetry if it is a large, flat plane.

# Electrostatic Forces and Energy
## Coulomb's Law
- The magnitude of the electrostatic force between two charges is described by Coulomb's Law:
\\[F=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}=\frac1{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\\]
where \\(F\\) is the magnitude of the force, \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\) are the charges on each particle, and r is the distance between the particles.
- \\(k\\) denotes Coulomb's constant, and \\(\epsilon_0\\) denotes a closely related constant called the vacuum permitivity. The values \\(k\\) and \\(\frac1{4\pi\epsilon_0}\\) are used interchangeably in Coulomb's law.

## Electric Field
- Electic field is the force that acts on a particle per unit charge on each particle. Force and electric field are related by the formula
\\[\overrightarrow F=\overrightarrow Eq\\]
where \\(\overrightarrow E\\) is the eletric field vector, \\(\overrightarrow F\\) is the electric force vector, and \\(q\\( is the charge of the particle being acted upon.
- The strength of the electric field at a distance from a point charge follows the formula
\\[E=k\frac{q}{r^2}\\]
where \\(k\\) is Coulomb's constant, \\(q\\) is the charge, and \\(r\\) is the distance from the charge.

## Electric Potential
- The electric force is associated with electric potential energy just as gravitational force is associated with gravitational potential energy. The electric potential energy of a system of two point charges follows the formula
\\[U=-k\frac{q_1q_2}{r}\\]
- Electric potential is defined as the energy per unit charge on an object. Electric potential and energy are both scalar and are related by the formula
\\[U=Vq\\]
- From this equation, you can derive the expression for the electric potential around a point charge:
\\[V=k\frac{q}{r}\\]
- The electric field strength is the derivative of electric potential:
\\[E=\frac{dV}{dr}\\]
- The electric potential difference between two points can be found by integrating the electric field any the path between them:
\\[\Delta V=\int_b^a\overrightarrow E\cdot d\overrightarrow r\\]
where a and b refer to the starting and ending coordinates
<div class="callout callout--info">
Note the dot product here. \\(\overrightarrow E\cdot d\overrightarrow r\\) is equivalent to \\(Er\cos \theta\\). In AP, you will almost always be integrating over a straight line parallel to the electric field, so you usually don't have to worry about \\(\cos\theta\\).

# Gauss's Law
## The Formula
- Electric flux (\\(\Phi\\)) is defined as the total electric field passing through a surface. It follows the formula
\\[\Phi=\oint \overrightarrow E\cdot d\overrightarrow A\\]
where \\(\overrightarrow E\\) is the electric field vector and \\(\overrightarrow A\\) is the area vector. \\(\oint\\) denotes a surface integral. You will never need to evaluate this integral in AP. You will almost always use the algebraic form of the rule:
\\[\Phi=EA\cos\theta\\]
(TODO: insert an image that makes the concept clearer)

- Gauss's Law states:
\\[\oint E\cdot dA=\frac Q{\epsilon_0}\\]
The left side of the equation represents electric flux through a closed surface. In AP Physics, this will usually be a sphere, cylinder, or plane. On the right side, \\(Q\\) denotes the total charge encolsed within that surface epsilon_0 is the vacuum permitivity.
	
## Applications
- If no charge is enclosed by a closed surface, the net flux through that surface will be 0. The electric flux entering the surface will be equal to the electric flux leaving the surface.
- For a spherically symmetric charge distribution, you can imagine a sphere enclosing it. The surface area of this sphere is \\(4\pi r^2\\), so the total electric flux passing through the sphere is \\(\Phi=4\pi r^2E=\frac Q{\epsilon_0}\\). From here, you can use Gauss's law to solve for the electric field strength at any point on the sphere's surface.

- If you draw a cylinder if radius \\(r\\) and length \\(h\\) around a cylindrical charge distribution, the flux through that cylinder will be \\(\Phi=2\pi rhE=\frac Q{\epsilon_0}\\) (the cylinder's surface area times electric flux). Then you can use Gauss's law to solve for \\(E\\) at any point on the cylinder's surface.

- Planar charge distributions are typically described by a surface charge density (\\(\sigma\\)). Remember that \\(\sigma=\frac QA\\).
The total flux through a plane of area \\(A\\) is \\(2EA\\) because the plane has two sides; the flux leaving one side is \\(EA\\), so the flux leaving through both sides is \\(2EA\\).
Gauss's law now becomes \\(2EA=\frac{\sigma A}{\epsilon_0}\\). The areas cancel out and you can solve for \\(E\\) on the plane's surface.
