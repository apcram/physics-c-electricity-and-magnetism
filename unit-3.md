# Electric Current
## Current
- Electric current is defined as the amount of charge that passes through a region every second. It follows the formula:
\\[I=\frac{dQ}{dt}\\]
where \\(I\\) is electric current, \\(Q\\) is the amount of charge that has passed through a point in a circuit, and \\(t\\) is time
- Conventional current: The direction of the current is defined as the direction that positive charge flows. Technically, only negative charges (electrons) ever move through a circuit, but an electron moving in one direction can be treated as a proton moving in the opposite direction, and all of the math will work out.
- Current density is defined as the current flowing per unit area of the wire's cross section. It follows the formula:
\\[I=\overrightarrow J\cdot\overrightarrow A\\]
where \\(I\\) is current, \\(\overrightarrow J\\) is current density, and \\(\overrightarrow A\\) is the cross-sectional area vector (remember that the direction of \\(\overrightarrow A\\) is perpendicular to the cross-section). In AP, it's usually safe to ignore the \\(\cos\theta\\) from the dot product, so the equation becomes \\(I=JA\\).
- Current also has a microscopic definition:
\\[I=Nev_dA\\]
where \\(N\\) is the number of charge carriers per unit volume, \\(e\\) is the elementary charge, \\(A\\) is cross-sectional area, and \\(v_d\\) is drift velocity: the average velocity that charge carriers move in the wire. \\(v_d\\) is usually extremely slow.

## Resistance
- The motion of charge is driven by a potential difference, or voltage (\\(V\\)), which creates an electric field in the wire (remember \\(E=\frac{dV}{dr}\\)), pushing charge through it. Additionally, resistance (\\(R\\)) is a property of a conductor which resists the motion of charge. Ohm's Law relates voltage, current, and resistance:
\\[V=IR\\]
- The resistance of a conductor can be calculated with the equation:
\\[R=\frac{\rho l}{A}\\]
where \\(R\\) is resistance, \\(l\\) is the length of the conductor, and \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area of the conductor. \\(\rho\\) denotes resistivity, which has a value specific to the type of material the conductor is made of.
- Current density relates to resistivity and the electric field strength in a wire by the following formula:
\\[\overrightarrow E=\rho \overrightarrow J\\]
where \\(\rho\\) is the wire's resistivity and \\(\overrightarrow J\\) is the current density.
- The definition of resistance can be derived from the microscopic current definition:  
Start with \\(I=Nev_dA\\)  
You can find current density: \\(J=\frac IA=Nev_d\\)  
You can then calculate voltage: \\(V=El=\rho J l=\rho Nev_d l\\)  
Then you can find resistance: \\(R=\frac VI=\frac{\rho Nev_dl}{Nev_dA}=\frac{\rho l}A\\)
 
## Power
- When current flows through a resistor, the kinetic energy of moving charge carriers is converted to heat.
- Power (\\(P\\)) in a circuit is the amount of energy converted to heat per second. It follows the formula:
\\[P=IV=I^2R=\frac{V^2}R\\]

# Circuits with resistors and batteries
## Series and Parallel Circuits
- Series circuits have resistors arranged like this:  
<center>![](series.png)</center>
- The total resistance of a series circuit is equal to the sum of the resistances of all the individual resistors. This is expressed mathematically as:
\\[R_s=\sum _i R_i\\]
- In a series circuit, the current is the same at all points.
- Parallel circuits look like this:
<center>![](parallel.png)</center>
- The total resistance of a parallel circuit follows the formula:
\\[\frac 1{R_p}=\sum_i\frac1{R_i}\\]
- In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each branch is the same.

## Kirchoff's Rules
- Current rule: the total current entering a junction must be equal to the total current leaving that junction.
- Loop rule: If you add up the voltage differences across any closed loop in a circuit, the result will be zero.

## Other Circuit Components
- Ammeters measure current. An ideal ammeter has negligible resistance and must be placed in series with a circuit to determine the current flowing through it.
- Voltmeters measure voltage. An ideal voltmeter has very large or infinite resistance and must be placed in parallel with a circuit.
- Batteries may have internal resistance.

# RC Circuits
## Capacitance
- Remember the formula for capacitance:
\\[C=\frac QV\\]
- If you have multiple capacitors wired in parallel, they will behave as a single capacitor with a capacitance following the formula
\\[C_p=\sum_iC_i\\]
- If you have multiple capacitors wired in series, they will behave as a single capacitor with a capacitance following the formula
\\[\frac 1{C_s}=\sum_i\frac1{C_i}\\]
- When capacitors are wired in parallel, the total charge stored in the circuit is equal to the sum of the charges stored on each capacitor.
- When capacitors are wired in series, each has the same charge \\(Q\\), and the total charge stored in the circuit is equal to \\(Q\\)

## Behavior
- RC circuits contain resistors and capacitors. \\(R\\) denotes the equivalent resistance of all the resistors, and \\(C\\) denotes the equivalent resistance of all the capacitors.
- Capacitors take time to charge and dicharge.
- When a capacitor charges, the voltage, charge, and current in the capcitor as a function of time can be found by solving a differential equation. You don't need to solve this equation on the exam; you should just know that the equation will always contain a factor of \\(e^{-\frac t{RC}}\\)
- \\(RC\\) is called the time constant and is sometimes denoted as \\(\tau\\)
- At time \\(t=0\\), an uncharged capacitor will behave as a bare wire with no voltage difference across it, and the current through the circuit can be found using Ohm's law for the resistor.
- As \\(t\\) approaches infinity, the capacitor will become fully charged and act as a break in the circuit (there will be no current flow through it).
